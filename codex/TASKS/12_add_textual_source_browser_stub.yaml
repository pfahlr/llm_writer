title: Add Textual-based MCP source browser stub (experimental)
description: >
  Add a minimal Textual application stub that can be invoked separately
  to browse MCP results and, in the future, integrate with planning mode.

dependencies:
  - 06

goals:
  - Provide a Textual app skeleton that can display a simple list of
    NormalizedItems.
  - Keep it optional and non-critical to core flows.

artifacts:
  - src/simple_rag_writer/mcp/source_browser_app.py
  - tests/test_source_browser_stub.py

steps:
  - Create a simple Textual app that:
    - Uses a static list of NormalizedItems or stubbed data.
    - Renders them in a scrollable list or table.
  - Optionally add a CLI hook or doc note.

testing:
  - Minimal tests to ensure the Textual app class can be instantiated.
  - Run pytest.
